## Introduction
This project provides a synthetic dataset for point cloud anomaly detection. We provide 3D point clouds and meshs for training and testing 3D anomaly detection algorithms.
Note that we expanded from the original 40 classes to 50 classes and put the new 10 classes in the â€˜newâ€™ folders.Our paper can be found here.[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14897)


## Data description

+ overview of Anomaly-ShapeNet

Anomaly-ShapeNet comprises a total of 1600 samples which are distributed across 40(+10) distinct categories. There are six kinds of anomalies, including bulge, concavity, crack, holes, and broken. All the obj or pcd file have been watertighted before to obtain a more smooth surface.
| Datasets |   Category numbers  | Anomaly types| Train num(1cls) |  Test num(1cls) | Point num | Anomaly portion | 
|--------------|:----:|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:-------:|
| Anomaly-ShapeNet |    50    |     6    |    4    |   15~24   |   8K~30K   |   1%~7%   |

## Benchmark
Our benchmark for Anomaly ShapaNet and Real3D-AD are listed here [Benchmark](https://github.com/Chopper-233/Anomaly-ShapeNet/blob/main/Benchmark.pdf). Some metrics like P-AP for Anomaly-ShapeNet is ignored because they are not suitable for our dataset.
